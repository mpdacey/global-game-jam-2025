====== DESCRIPTION ======

In Bubble Barista you run a bubble tea (boba) shop. But your customers don't place orders! They just tell you a bit about their day and you need to make their drink to match their feelings.

The bubble colours/flavours match four emotional states:
raspberry = angry/mad
grape = sad
mango = happy
lime = surprised

Dispense the bubbles to match their feelings.

The tea colours match the source of their emotions:
strawberry = random event (accident, shock, lotto win)
coconut = work (job, study, boss)
peach = personal (family, friends, close connections)
matcha = activities (hobbies, wellbeing, health)

Fill the cup with the correct tea.

Each day a range of recurring characters come to your shop, from Easy Pete the super happy family man; Micah the schoolkid; Alex the twenty something with relationship problems, and others.

1. In the early levels the key words will be highlighted to help you correctly identify the emotions.
2. In the later levels youâ€™ll have to read carefully to see how they feel and match their drinks.
3. Towards the end of the game, it might be necessary to ask a question in order to find out how they feel.
